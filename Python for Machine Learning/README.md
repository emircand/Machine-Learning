The course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Python programming and its application in data analysis. It consists of seven modules, each covering specific topics and accompanied by practical exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Curriculum

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. Introduction and review
2. Object-oriented programming
3. Preparing data
4. Processing data
5. Working with datasets
6. Data visualization
7. Wrap up

Each module is carefully structured to help you dive deeper into real-life problems and further develop your skills by solving practical challenges.

## Duration

The course is estimated to take approximately 5-6 hours to complete. However, the pace of learning may vary depending on individual preferences and prior knowledge.

## Requirements

To enroll in this course, you need:

- A working computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Basic Python programming skills

## Learning Activities

The course offers various learning activities to enhance your understanding and proficiency in Python programming and data analysis. These activities include:

### Video Sessions

The course provides video sessions that cover the core concepts and techniques. It is recommended to mark each video session as complete upon finishing. Additionally, code examples relevant to the video content can be found under the "Materials" tab.

### Coding

To visualize, write, and run code throughout the course, we utilize Google Colab. You are required to upload the code examples and exercises from the course onto the platform.

### Guided Projects

Within each module, you will engage in practical programming tasks guided by the course materials. A template Colab notebook is provided in the "Materials" tab alongside the video sessions, allowing you to solve the tasks independently.

### Assessments

At the end of each module, you are required to pass an assessment with a minimum score of 60% to proceed to the next module. These assessments serve as checkpoints to evaluate your understanding and progress.

### Final Assessment

To receive a certificate upon completion of the course, you must pass the final assessment with a minimum score of 60%. You have up to five attempts to achieve the required score.
